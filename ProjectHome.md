NOTE: They said that the game cabinet uses the arrow keys as the joystick (no change). It may or may not be able to go diagonally. The top three buttons are mapped to QWE and the bottom three are RTY. We can decide which setup works best next time and we can always leave it so that if people play on a keyboard they can use either or/both control schemes.

This is a project that a few of us (currently unnamed) people have begun for the RPI Game Development Club. It is a side-scroller similar to the Simpsons game with the most unique features making this game stand out from all of the rest are the unique storyline and the art style of the game (both of which currently don't exist, but they will soon!). Please note that our license will change as soon as we discuss which license we want to distribute under.

On a side note, we will release a download when there is something fun to do in the game. Currently, the game does pretty much nothing except moving around. If you feel like playing it, get it from the svn, until we have decided that the game is "done" in some sort of aspect (like you can play level 1).
